# Real-Time-Weather-App

This Weather Dashboard application was an interesting assignment that had many challenges. While my app is not yet completed and I intend to submit it once I can get everything working for
regrading what I have works well. I used Jquery to write the script file and found that it made my code very clean and precise.

Type in the name of the city you wish to pull the weather information for. Displayed will be the city's name and country, the current date, an icon that shows the current conditions, the temperature, humidity level, a text version of the conditions, the wind speed, the hi/low, and the UV index. The UV index will change color depending on the severity with green being favorable, orange being mild, red being severe, and pink being extreme.

I will work with a TA to figure out how to make the localStorage work so for right now the button "Past Searches" is commented out. I also need to speak with them on how I am to pull the information from both APIs and compile it into a 5 day forecast as I am not sure where to even begin with that other than trying to make them an object but, in trying to do the same thing in localStorage, I have not had much success and I am still not understanding the full process of that.
